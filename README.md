# TonUINO DIY Music Box Project

Welcome to the TonUINO DIY Music Box Project! This project provides you with a set of scripts and instructions to create your very own customized [TonUINO](https://github.com/tonuino/TonUINO-TNG) music box. The TonUINO project draws inspiration from the [Toniebox](https://tonies.com/), offering a fun and engaging DIY experience to build a personalized music box for both children and adults. This project utilizes an Arduino, an MP3 module, an RFID reader, a micro-SD card, and other components to play music by scanning RFID cards.

## Scripts

### `_tools/copy-to-sd-card.ts`

This script is designed to copy all sound files to the SD card efficiently. It ensures that files on the FAT filesystem of the SD card are organized in alphabetical order, which is crucial for error-free playback. Additionally, it removes any characters from folder and file names that are not numbers, allowing for clear descriptions that can be easily managed during the transfer process.

### `_tools/download-podcast-episodes.ts`

This script simplifies the process of automatically downloading episodes from one or more podcast feeds. The downloaded files are named with an index, making them compatible with the `_tools/copy-to-sd-card.ts` script.

## Audio Content

Here is a list of the included audio content in this project, which you can customize to your liking. All included content is licensed under a free license.
